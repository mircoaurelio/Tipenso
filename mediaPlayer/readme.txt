Implement a simple webpage embedding the Spotify artist player (Spotify Artist Embed), featuring a fullscreen WebGL shader-based music visualizer. Since real-time audio data cannot be accessed directly due to DRM restrictions, create a procedurally generated shader visualization inspired by rhythmic, abstract, and pulsating animations that approximate synchronization. Use GLSL shaders (e.g., ShaderToy-style shaders) within a WebGL context (e.g., Three.js or pure WebGL), optimizing performance to smoothly render visuals across desktop and mobile browsers. Ensure responsive design and intuitive user interaction, triggering visuals upon playback via JavaScript events tied to Spotify's embedded player iframe state changes.
